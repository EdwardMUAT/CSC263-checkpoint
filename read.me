So far what I have is my tic-tac-toe board it is fully functional and gives a prompt that either X or O has won.
What I plan to get working next is Rock, Paper, Scissors; it works but not entirely the way I would want I am thinking of adding images or some
sort of effects to make it look better, and once I am done with that I will tweak my chat bot.
